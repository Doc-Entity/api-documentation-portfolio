# 💻 API Documentation Portfolio

This repository is a collection of API documentation projects I have worked on and continue to develop, both through open-source contributions and personal practice. Each project contains examples, tutorials, and reference guides to make the APIs easier to understand and use.

I am focused on deepening my skills in API documentation, exploring RESTful APIs, OpenAPI specifications, and best practices for creating developer-friendly guides. This portfolio reflects my efforts to learn, experiment, and produce clear, practical documentation.

You are welcome to explore the projects, provide feedback, or connect.📚

## Projects

Each project is contained in its own folder with a README, example requests/responses, and optional OpenAPI specifications.  

- **PokéAPI:** A growing set of guides for the PokéAPI, created as part of my *personal portfolio*. Current focus includes pagination, using `limit` and `offset` query parameters, and navigating `next` and `previous` pages. Future updates will expand to additional endpoints and practical usage examples. This project is independent and not affiliated with the official PokéAPI as of now.




## Open Source Contributions

These are projects where I have contributed documentation improvements:  

- **[ZSweep](https://github.com/oug-t/zsweep):** Improved the contributors section using the GitHub API, added a styled graph, enhanced documentation with project history, technical terms, Vim motions, and new mine patterns for better clarity and usability.
- **[Obsidian Lovely Bases](https://github.com/aitorllj93/obsidian-lovely-bases):** Documented all status badges on the views documentation pages, explaining their meanings and usage, and created a new `AboutTheDoc.mdx` page to clarify how to read the documentation for new users.
- **[Layr](https://github.com/manasdutta04/layr):** Updated the README installation instructions with step-by-step screenshots, clearer formatting, and beginner-friendly notes to help new users get started quickly.
